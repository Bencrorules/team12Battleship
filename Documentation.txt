Team 12 Project 1 Documentation

Person-Hour Estimation:
	20 Hours. This rough estimate comes from evaluating the difficulty of
	making battleship per the instructions as well as looking over the
	additional documents, meetings, and communication needed. We suspect 
	a total of 2 person hours dedicated to meetings, 4 person hours for
	documentation of work and organization/communication, and 14 to decide
	what's the best way to construct a game and executing that as a team.

Person-Hour Log:
	General communication among team members (number of messages * 30 seconds): 103 minutes
	GTA meeting: 40 minutes
	CATME team discussion prep-work: 30 minutes
	CATME team discussion: 80 minutes
	Time spent documenting and submitting team discussion: 30 minutes
	Discord and Github repo setup: 60 minutes

Code Documentation:
	Our code should look quite similar to labs in Programming 1 and 2. Written 
	in C++, our battleship game has many classes such as game, player, and ship
	each performing various functions to get the game working. 

	The game class functions as the core component in running battlship. Initially
	called by the executive class from main.cpp, this class creates the visual for 
	an empty board and begins by asking the player for the number of ships and where
	to place them.

	The ship class handles the individual ships themselves by storing the ships
	location coordinates and providing a sank variable.
