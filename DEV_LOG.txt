[FIX] - fixed condition check for coordinates of ships with length > 1.
    i. Coordinate should not overlap with the previous coordinate of same ship.
        exception.(A,2 and A,3) :: check if BOTH x and y coords are equal. 
    ii. Cooridnate should not be apart from previous coordinate.
        :: check if either X or Y difference with previous X, Y is greater than 1.
[FIX] - Fixed seg fault when adding ship to player.


[ADD] - added new functions:
    Player Class
        addShip - new function with 5 arguments.
        getShipInfo - *for debugging purpose* prints the latest coordinate update.
        getPrevX,YInfo - *for debugging purpose* might not use later.

[MOD] - removed unnecessary codes and added additional codes:
    Game Class
        tempShip was not needed in game.cpp -> used it on new addShip function instead.
        check for valid coordinate input was added.
        *debugging purpose* display previous coordinate when there is an error.
        after coordinates are put, display the which ship, which spot, value of coordinate.
        removed declaring Player 1, 2 multiple times which wasn't needed (seg fault).
        
[ERR] - temporarily fixed by //
    Game Class
        UNIX make was not able to find <charconv>

[NEED] - 
    1. One more condition, ships should not be overlapped with previous ships for the same player. Add condition check.
    2. Gameplay function, calling coordinates, killShip() etc.
    3. Display live battleship board every turn.
    4. Need to implement the colored pins for the display board.

[] - at this point of build, inserting coordinates and ship data to both players work fine. No seg fault.
    just no interaction after all the coordinates are put.
